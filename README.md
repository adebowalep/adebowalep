- üëã Hey!
- My name is Adebowale, I am a graduate student focussing on applied Machine Learning. 
-  
- üëÄ I am passionate about using AI tools and platforms for individuals and businesses to create smarter software to solve problems that seems unrealistic. 

This is my experience and what I am working on.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently doing my internship in Laboratoire J.A. Dieudonn√©  Universit√© de Nice Sophia-AnNpolis / CNRS,where I am  developing a numerical tool to extract 3D geometries from experimental images of mouse lungs, acquired with the Light Sheets technic by C. Feral in IRCAN (Nice). The numerical tool will be adapted from a tool already used in LJAD for scanners of the human lungs. It needs to be adapted to the mouse lung, which is far smaller than the human lung, and to the Light Sheets technic, which produces images with different properties than scanners.
Then, in a second step, I will work on experimental maps of the mechanical properties of the mouses lung acquired using Atomic Force Microscopy technic in IRCAN. MY goal will be to project these maps on the generated mesh without losing too much information during the process.
My objective is to set up a mesh and a field of mechanical properties of mouses lungs that will be used for future finite elements simulations.
