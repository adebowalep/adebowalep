Hello there!

My name is Adebowale, and I'm a graduate student specializing in applied Machine Learning. My passion lies in using AI tools and platforms to create smarter software that solves seemingly unrealistic problems for individuals and businesses.

Currently, I'm doing my internship at Laboratoire J.A. Dieudonné Université de Nice Sophia-AnNpolis / CNRS, where I'm developing a numerical tool to extract 3D geometries from experimental images of mouse lungs using the Light Sheets technique. My goal is to set up a mesh and a field of mechanical properties of mouse lungs for future finite elements simulations.

I hold a Masters of Science (M.Sc.) in Mathematics with a focus on Mathematical Modeling and Finance from the University of Cote D'Azur (Erasmus Exchange), the University of Hamburg (Erasmus Exchange), and the University of L'Aquila (Programme Coordinator). Additionally, I have a Bachelor of Science (B.S) in Mathematics from Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto, Nigeria, where I graduated as the best student in my class.

I have experience coding in Python, and I am  scikit-learn and PyTorch. I also have experience dealing with relational databases (MySQL) and non-relational databases, as well as back-end development using PHP and Laravel.

Some of the projects I have worked on include building neural networks from scratch using Numpy and PyTorch, building detection and classification models using Python, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn, creating a recommendation engine with neural networks and Restricted Boltzman Machines (RBM), building a network using LSTM with NLP to generate character sequences, and implementing semantic segmentation on a custom dataset using a U-Net architecture. Additionally, I have built a VAE to generate new images of handwritten digits.

I won the Best Graduating Student award during my Bachelor's program, and I am looking to collaborate on projects related to Computer Vision.
